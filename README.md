# ESP32-Based Tachometer System

Welcome to the ESP32-Based Tachometer project repository!
This project involves building a tachometer system to measure the RPM of a motor wheel using an IR sensor that detects a white strip on the wheel.
The ESP32 microcontroller processes the data and displays the RPM on a 16x2 I2C LCD screen. It was developed as part of the (Team i5 â€“ IoT and Embedded Systems) Intel OneAPI Student Club at USAR, GGSIPU.

## Components Used
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**
- **IR Sensor**
- **16x2 I2C LCD Screen**
- **Motor with Wheel (with a white strip for detection)**
- **Breadboard**

## Software
- **Arduino IDE**: Used to write, compile, and upload the code to the ESP32 board.

## Project Structure
- **Code**: Arduino code that calculates RPM by counting the IR sensor's pulse rate and processes this data for display on the 16x2 LCD screen.
- **Project Photographs**: Images showing the setup and working of the tachometer system.
